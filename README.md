Lab on inheritance

For this lab,
Follow the diagram on page 290 to modify the Network-v2 class.  Add the CommentedPost class, move the MessagePost and PhotoPost classes to inherit from CommentedPost and then add an EventPost class to inherit directly from post.

Modify the fields and methods as necessary.
